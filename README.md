# Odin Support for IntelliJ

This plugin adds support for the [Odin programming language](https://www.odin-lang.org) to IntelliJ IDEA.
You can add it to your JetBrains IDE using the "Plugin" settings panel or by visiting the [Plugin Page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22933-odin-lang-support).

## Resources

### Odin
Odin is in constant development. Visit the  [Odin Website](https://www.odin-lang.org)
for the latest news and features.

### Grammar
When crafting the BNF rules for Odin, I drew a lot of inspiration from Go.
* Go Language resources:
  * [Grammar-Kit grammar for Go](https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin/blob/master/grammars/go.bnf)
  * [ANTLR4 Grammar for Go](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/golang/)

For more info on how to use JetBrain's Grammar-Kit to write custom languages see the official
[Grammar-Kit documentation](https://github.com/JetBrains/Grammar-Kit/blob/master/HOWTO.md).
